              we know that the best forward chain starting at from is from-fwd.
              but it is possible that there is an alternative chaining arriving
              at fwd that is better, such that alt-fwd is to be preferred to
              from-fwd. an analogous situation is possible in backward chaining,
              where an alternative link bck-alt may be better than bck-from.

               before making the new link, check if fwd/bck are already chained,
               and in such case compare the scores of the proposed chaining to
               the existing one, and keep only the best of the two.

                there is an undesirable aspect of this procedure: the result may
                depend on the order of exploration. consider the following
                configuration:

                 a x-------x b
                 /
                 /
                 c x---x d    with score(a-b) < score(c-b) < score(c-d)
                 or equivalently ||a-b|| > ||b-c|| > ||c-d||

                  let us consider two possible orders of exploration.

                   order: a,b,c
                   we will first chain a-b when exploring a. when analyzing the
                   backward links of b, we will prefer c-b, and a-b will be unlinked.
                   finally, when exploring c, c-d will be preferred and c-b will be
                   unlinked. the result is just the chaining c-d.

                    order: c,b,a
                    we will first chain c-d when exploring c. then, when exploring
                    the backward connections of b, c-b will be the preferred link;
                    but because c-d exists already and has a better score, c-b
                    cannot be linked. finally, when exploring a, the link a-b will
                    be created because there is no better backward linking of b.
                    the result is two chainings: c-d and a-b.

                     we did not found yet a simple algorithm to solve this problem. by
                     simple, we mean an algorithm without two passes or the need to
                     re-evaluate the chaining of points where one link is cut.

                      for most edge points, there is only one possible chaining and this
                      problem does not arise. but it does happen and a better solution
                      is desirable.

x, y and curve_limits; it also computes N (the number of edge points) and
M (the number of curves).

x[i] and y[i] (0<=i<N) store the sub-pixel coordinates of the edge points.
curve_limits[j] (0<=j<=M) stores the limits of each chain in lists x and y.

x, y, and curve_limits will be allocated.

example:

curve number k (0<=k<M) consists of the edge points x[i],y[i]
for i determined by curve_limits[k] <= i < curve_limits[k+1].

curve k is closed if x[curve_limits[k]] == x[curve_limits[k+1] - 1] and
y[curve_limits[k]] == y[curve_limits[k+1] - 1].

     there cannot be more than X*Y edge points to be put in the output list:
     edge points must be local maxima of gradient modulus, so at most half of
     the pixels could be so. when a closed curve is found, one edge point will
     be put twice to the output. even if all possible edge points (half of the
     pixels in the image) would form one pixel closed curves (which is not
     possible) that would lead to output X*Y edge points.

      for the same reason, there cannot be more than X*Y curves: the worst case
      is when all possible edge points (half of the pixels in the image) would
      form one pixel chains. in that case (which is not possible) one would need
      a size for curve_limits of X*Y/2+1. so X*Y is enough.

     (curve_limits requires one more item than the number of curves.
     a simplest example is when only one chain of length 3 is present:
     curve_limits[0] = 0, curve_limits[1] = 3.)

                     to understand that this code actually repeats the first point,

                      let us say that the algorithm starts by point a. it will store
                      the coordinates of point a and then unlink a-b. then, will store
                      point b and unlink b-c, and so on. but the link d-a is still
                      there. (point a is no longer pointing backwards to d, because
                      both links are removed at each step. but d is indeed still
                      pointing to a.) so it will arrive at point a again and store its
                      coordinates again as last point. there, it cannot continue
                      because the link a-b was removed, there would be no next point,
                      k would be -1 and the curve is finished.
